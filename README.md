# Hey there folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alberto Sardinha, but everyone just calls me Sardinha :fish: (Pilchard). 

I'm a Brazilian software developer (mostly web) focused on learning new technologies, back-end code and (a little) game development. I studied at IFSP - Caraguatatuba and I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo.
My goal is to create solutions to help people with (maybe random) tasks.

Currently working as a software developer at Quero EducaÃ§Ã£o.

ðŸ”­ Interested in Ruby on Rails, Python and Javascript.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning VueJS.

Below you will have a picture of me showing my code working, and where to contact me:
